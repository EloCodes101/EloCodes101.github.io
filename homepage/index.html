            <br>

            <p id="intro">Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening! Welcome to the official Stories of Teyvat website! You might be wondering: What is Stories of Teyvat? And I am here to provide you with answers! Stories of Teyvat, or SOT for short, is a private, small, VRChat Roleplay run every Saturday from 7:00 PM EST to 3:00 AM EST. Our group runs a DnD (Dungeons and Dragons) - Like campaign based on and taking place in the world of the hit game, Genshin Impact. However, since our roleplay has been running since before most content of the game came out, our Teyvat is very different from the one presented in the game. It has its own unique flair found within its differing characters, nations, and overall story, but it still maintains parts of the canon of the game alongside our own group’s additions. If you are looking for a more dramatic take on Genshin Impact’s world, a place to make friends, or just an opportunity to immerse yourself in the world of Teyvat, then Stories of Teyvat might be just everything you’re looking for!</p>

            <h1 id="headingintro">How to Join Us</h1>

            <br>

            <p id="intro"> If you are interested in joining us, here is what the process looks like:</p>

            <br>

            <p id="intro"> 1. Reach out to one of our lovely moderators! They will make sure to provide you with any material you need and to answer any questions you may have.</p>

            <br>

            <p id="intro"> 2. One piece of said material that will be provided is a Google Form. This is your official application to the group! Please answer the questions on it to the best of your ability and share only what you are comfortable sharing!</p>

            <br>

            <p id="intro"> 3. A moderator will then review your answers. If they see you as being a possible fit for the group, they will invite you to an interview. There, they will ask the same questions alongside some new ones. Based on this interview, moderators will discuss further whether or not you are fit to join. </p>

            <br>

            <p id="intro"> 4. If the moderators all agree you meet the requirements to join SOT, then congratulations! You will receive an invitation to join the Discord and VRChat servers from a moderator.</p>

            <br>

            <p id="intro"> 5. After joining, you will need to spend two weeks spectating sessions and two weeks playing NPCs before being allowed to freely create and play characters.</p>

            <br>

            <p id="intro"> 6. If you make it through all that then, again, congratulations! You have become an official member of SOT. Buckle up because this campaign is a wild ride!</p>
